      <h2>SEGMENT ONE</h2>
      <p>
        In a parallax website, background images 
        or sections may move at a slower rate than 
        foreground content, creating a sense of 
        perspective and immersion. This technique is
         often used to tell a story, showcase products, or 
         provide a unique and interactive browsing 
         experience. Parallax scrolling can add a modern 
         and dynamic feel to a website, enhancing user 
         engagement and making the design more memorable.

        However, it's important to note that while parallax websites 
        can be visually impressive, they also require careful 
        optimization to ensure they load quickly and provide a 
        smooth user experience across different devices and screen sizes

        Parallax websites are a type of web design where elements on a webpage 
        move at different speeds as the user scrolls, creating an illusion of 
        depth and a visually engaging experience. This effect 
        is achieved by using HTML, CSS, and sometimes 
        JavaScript to manipulate the position and movement of elements.
